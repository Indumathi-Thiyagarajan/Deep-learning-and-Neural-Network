Neural network for sentiment analysis:

    

    1. Input: The sentence is converted into numerical vectors. Each word is represented as vector of number through **word2vec** or through vector that represents the presence of freq(bag of words)
    2. Hidden Layer or Perceptrons:
          The "freetime" perceptron would likely activate strongly if the input sentence contains words or phrases related to leisure, relaxation, or time off.
          The "family" perceptron would definitely activate strongly if the input sentence contains words or phrases related to family, relationships, or loved ones.
          The "hungry" perceptron would likely activate strongly  if the input sentence contains words or phrases related to food, eating, or being hungry.

  **In actual neural networks, the model learns the features automatically, and those features are often abstract and difficult to describe in simple terms, they are not predefined by humans in that way**.
  
    3. Output Layer: The output layer receives the activation values from the three perceptrons. If the "freetime" and "family" perceptrons have high activation values, and the     
    "hungry" perceptron has a medium high value, the output layer would likely predict "happy."
